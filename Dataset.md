About Dataset
Content
Detecting Facial Landmarks is a subset of shape prediction problem. Given an input image (and normally an ROI that specifies the object of interest), a shape predictor attempts to localize key points of interest along the shape.

Facial landmarks are used to localize and represent salient regions of the face, such as:

Eyes
Eyebrows
Nose
Mouth
Jawline

Facial landmarks have been successfully applied to face alignment, head pose estimation, face swapping, blink detection and much more.
